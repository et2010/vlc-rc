;;; Commentary:
;; Using the rc interface of vlc Emacs can control
;; media playing quite easily.

;; WARN
;; some functionality doesn't work while the stream is paused on vlc
;; versions before 4.0.x. There's no real fix for this aside from
;; moving to a newer version of VLC.

;; WARN
;; if you have an open telnet or netcat connection to the VLC server
;; any outgoing requests from emacs will be blocked until you release
;; it. This means for some commands (such as play), emacs will appear
;; to do nothing, whereas other commands such as get video track list
;; will return nothing because the process took too long to respond.
;;
;; TLDR; You've got an interface to vlc from emacs... USE IT!!!

;; TODO
;; create custom major mode for the client buffer so that you can use
;; it as a shell to directly interface with vlcrc

;; unbound commands:
;; status
;; info
;; key
;; get_title
;;
;; titles & chapter commands

Parameters
==========
command-name
  symbol used to define the name of the spawned functions. They'll be appended to
  `vlc/get-' and `vlc/set-' respectively, where the former will be callable and
  the latter will not be.
message
  the actual command sent to the vlc-rc process through the client to both list
  all valid entries (when no argument is sent) and set its value (when an arg
  is sent).
match-regex
  regular expression used on the process response to find and extract valid entries.
  the expression should have two capture groups, the first is the argument sent to
  choose that entry, the second is a human readable name.
get-list-docstring
  documentation string for the get-list function
set-value-docstring
  documentation string for the set-list function
values-to-string
  convert the alist tuple response for each entry extracted using the match regex
  to a representable value string for read-completion.
allow-empty
  normally if a `vlc/get-' call doesn't produce any valid entries a warning will
  be issued. Sometimes this may be the desired behaviour, such as subtitles. If
  this value is true then empty lists will be ignored."
